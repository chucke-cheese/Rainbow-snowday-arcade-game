# Rainbow-snowday-arcade-game
Modification of the lower gate of Rainbow, or Snowday
This short project is an stl of a pulley and string guide that I used inside of Coastal Amusement's CEC Rainbow (same game as Snowday (see ref 1)).
I modified the bottom door of the game to operate similar to a garage door, to extend the life of the bottom door motor.
I moved the motor to the side of the interior space, and attached the motor to the bottom door via a string.
The bottom door was attached to the motor and to a counterweight hanging on the inside of the cabinet. 
The bootm door is now lifted, similar to a garage door opener, where the motor doing the lifting only has to lift a little of the doors weight.
The counterweight on the inside fo the cabinet ofsets the majority of the weight of the door.
It does this by having the string between the weight and the door strung through the string guide, over the pulley, and back through the string guide.
